For this assignment, you have the flexibility to choose any 5 of the following 10 features to implement:

Activity Logging: Create a feature that allows users to log daily activities, categorizing them by type. Each activity will have an associated carbon value, helping users understand their environmental impact.

Summary Views: Design a dashboard that provides a visual summary of the user's carbon footprint over time, using charts or graphs to illustrate trends.

Goal Setting: Implement a goal-setting feature where users can set personal targets for reducing their carbon footprint, with progress tracking and motivational feedback.

Notifications: Add optional notifications to remind users to log activities, helping them stay consistent in their tracking.

Resource Library: Develop a section with practical tips and resources for sustainable living, encouraging users to adopt eco-friendly habits.

Achievements: Introduce gamification by creating achievements for reaching milestones, making the experience engaging and rewarding.

Local Storage: Ensure that all data is stored locally in the browser, maintaining user privacy and enabling offline access.

Customizable UI: Allow users to personalize the appâ€™s interface, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.

Data Visualization: Design interactive charts and graphs to help users visualize their carbon footprint and identify areas for improvement.

User Profiles: Implement a profile feature that allows users to track their progress and personalize their experience.

Choose any combination of these features to complete the assignment while demonstrating your understanding of React!

Note: you do not need to have the application fully functional in all aspects. The goal is to complete just 5 features. You are welcome to complete additional features to further your grasp of a scalable front-end framework such as React.
